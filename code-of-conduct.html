            <h2>Virtual Event Code of Conduct</h2>
            </div>

            <h2>The Computational Research Integrity Conference (Cri-Conf) Virtual Meetings Conduct Policy</h2>
            <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors, vendors, partners, and Cri-Conf staff at Cri-Conf Virtual Event and any related events are required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct. Event organizers will enforce this Code throughout the event entirety.</p>
            <p>Prior to the virtual event (March 23-25, 2021), all participants are expected to be familiar with this policy.</p>
            <p>Participants must register for a Virtual Meeting and provide an email, text, phone or (for special needs) other contact where they can be reached during the Virtual Meeting. Registration constitutes consent to audio and visual recording (and use and alteration of the recording) by the Cri-Conf staff at the Meeting for non-commercial purposes aligned with the conference's mission. Failure to register, provide such contact, or be available via the contact provided is grounds for being disconnected from the Virtual Meeting at the participant’s cost, without further notice or process.</p>
            <p>Our aim in hosting a virtual event is to build a stronger community. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone feels welcome to participate, speak up, ask questions, and engage in conversation. This requires a harassment free and inclusive environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every participant. We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>
            <p>We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate during any aspect of this virtual event/conference, including talks, workshops, and social media such as Twitter, or other online media.</p>
            <p>Following a Code of Conduct allows Cri-Conf to create the best experience possible for all attendees.</p>

            <h2>Expected behavior:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
                <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
                <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert Cri-Conf staff if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
                <li>During this virtual event or any of its related events no participant should engage in harassment in any form.</li>
                <li>Do not disrupt the virtual meeting (e.g., “zoom-bombing”) or engage in harm or threats of harm of any kind. Do not create/contribute to a safety threat or unsafe or exclusionary situation.</li>
                <li>Do not make audio or visual recordings of the Virtual Meeting in any medium—and do not distribute audio or visual recordings of the Virtual Meeting (via social media or any other means).  Only Cri-Conf or its representatives may do so, after warning participants to give them an opportunity to opt out.</li>
                <li>Do not take or distribute pictures of or copy research posters/presentation materials unless explicit permission is granted.</li>
                <li>Participants violating these rules may be expelled from without a refund at the discretion of Cri-Conf. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Note About Differences of Opinion and Offense</h2>
            <p>To achieve the purposes of a virtual event in the limited time provided, with the universal benefit of all participants’ being fully engaged, discussions should be focused on the meeting topic at hand. All participants must be able and welcome to equitably and effectively participate.  It is not a violation of the Virtual Meetings Conduct Policy to express an opinion, raise research or describe an experience (“articulation”) that is at odds with the opinions of or is offensive to others—if the articulation is part of an on-point discussion of the Virtual Meeting topic at hand and is offered in a manner that does not interfere with others’ reasonable ability and welcome to participate fully. That means expressing differing positions with respect and consideration for all, in a manner that reflects intellectual rigor and is demonstrably mindful of minimizing, as reasonably possible, its potential adverse effect on others’ ability to participate.  (Offering an advance warning of the potential for impact on others is one way to demonstrate such respect and consideration for all.) It also means not making an articulation that is reasonably expected to cause offense gratuitously (i.e., unrelated or unnecessary for the work on that topic). It means not directing the articulation as a personal attack or put-down of an individual, and not dominating the discussion. It further means demonstrating consideration for anyone who appears to be in distress by promptly stopping the cause and demonstrating caring, while still pursuing a way to share pertinent information, with the moderator’s assistance if needed.</p>

            <h2>Reporting an incident:</h2>
            <p>If you see, overhear or experience a violation of the Code of Conduct during a virtual event, and would like to report a violation, you please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@cri-conf.org">contact@cri-conf.org</a></p>
