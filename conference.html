                            Both Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Association Rules Learning (ARL) enriched our
                            daily-lives through various applications, by improving axial roles in several domains. In
                            particular, the community detection in online social networks (OSN) has interested

                            for academic, commercial or further purposes. The aim of this paper is the identification of
                            communities in OSN using knowledge extraction based on association rules methods.
                            Furthermore, we propose a new approach, namely ARL Clustering, using association rules
                            learning for SNA. Particularly, we base our detection on userâ€™s friendships of OSN by
                            processing a four level technique to extract meaningful rules, converted later to
                            communities. The conducted experimentation was applied on two synthetic real-world networks,
                            and improved important results in identifying potential communities in comparison with
                            existing approaches.

                                researchers, for its valuable contribution in understanding systems complexity, as

                                communities in OSN using knowledge extraction based on association rules methods.
                                Furthermore, we propose a new approach, namely ARL Clustering, using association rules
                                learning for SNA. Particularly, we base our detection on userâ€™s friendships of OSN by
                                processing a four level technique to extract meaningful rules, converted later to
                                communities. The conducted experimentation was applied on two synthetic real-world

                            Both Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Association Rules Learning (ARL) enriched our
                            daily-lives through various applications, by improving axial roles in several domains. In
                            particular, the community detection in online social networks (OSN) has interested
                            researchers, for its valuable contribution in understanding systems complexity, as either
                            for academic, commercial or further purposes. The aim of this paper is the identification of
                            communities in OSN using knowledge extraction based on association rules methods.
                            Furthermore, we propose a new approach, namely ARL Clustering, using association rules
                            learning for SNA. Particularly, we base our detection on userâ€™s friendships of OSN by
                            processing a four level technique to extract meaningful rules, converted later to
                            communities. The conducted experimentation was applied on two synthetic real-world networks,
                            and improved important results in identifying potential communities in comparison with
                            existing approaches.

                                Both Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Association Rules Learning (ARL) enriched our
                                daily-lives through various applications, by improving axial roles in several domains.
                                In
                                particular, the community detection in online social networks (OSN) has interested
                                researchers, for its valuable contribution in understanding systems complexity, as
                                either
                                for academic, commercial or further purposes. The aim of this paper is the
                                identification of
                                communities in OSN using knowledge extraction based on association rules methods.
                                Furthermore, we propose a new approach, namely ARL Clustering, using association rules
                                learning for SNA. Particularly, we base our detection on userâ€™s friendships of OSN by
                                processing a four level technique to extract meaningful rules, converted later to
                                communities. The conducted experimentation was applied on two synthetic real-world
                                networks,
                                and improved important results in identifying potential communities in comparison with
                                existing approaches.
