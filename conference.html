                                Research misconduct in the federal regulation (42 C.F.R. Part 93) means fabrication,
                                falsification, or plagiarism (FFP) in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or
                                in
                                reporting research results (ยง 93.103). This session will discuss the types of questioned
                                data and tools that currently are used to identify and confirm FFP with special emphasis

                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                Computational research integrity and cancer research are young and old research fields,
                                respectively, and yet they have much in common. Cancer research involves the discovery
                                of
                                biological features that reliably distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. These
                                features
                                are targeted by drug developers to create cancer therapies that are tested by
                                researchers
                                and then applied by clinicians to patients. Similarly, computational research integrity
                                involves the identification of publication features that reliably depart from
                                established
                                norms or standards. These features inform the creation of automated tools that are then
                                tested and applied by researchers and publishers to manuscripts and papers. Based upon
                                our
                                experience of applying the semi-automated tool Seek &amp; Blastn to the molecular cancer
                                research literature, we will describe how the skill to employ automated literature
                                screening
                                tools needs to be matched by the will to apply these tools and then act upon their
                                results.
                                Beyond developing the skills to apply automated literature screening tools within
                                different
                                user groups, we propose that achieving the necessary willingness to tackle pervasive
                                research integrity problems will require the development of positive narratives that
                                speak
                                to shared aspirations and values.

                            <p>
                                Institutions face many challenges in managing complex research misconduct cases. From
                                the increased
                                public nature of allegations to the rapidly evolving technical landscape, research
                                integrity officers
                                have to develop expertise across many areas and identify tools to ensure the integrity
                                of these
                                complicated investigations. We will discuss common issues in institutional research
                                misconduct
                                proceedings and the growing need for technical solutions, for example record
                                sequestration, forensic
                                image and data analysis, and other variables that complicate institutional reviews. We
                                will shine a
                                light from the inside out, on how institutional investigations are more than spotting
                                problem images and
                                the critical work done to protect the integrity of the research record.

                            </h5>
                            <p>
                                In this talk I will describe a system that we are developing for the forensic analysis
                                of
                                images and other media extracted from a scientific publication. This system uses many
                                modern
                                media forensic methods to examine images and determine if the image has been likely
                                altered
                                or modified. The tools that are available include duplication detection, copy/move
                                detection, provenance analysis and media forensics tools. The current system has methods
                                for
                                extracting images, figures, and captions and maintaining the relative relationships of
                                the
                                figures in a paper. The system has a simple and intuitive web-based user interface, a
                                sophisticated database, and is easily extensible using Docker containers.

                                Institutional investigations are many times the first places where systematic problems
                                are
                                investigated. In many cases, these are the places where investigations are most
                                consequential because they carry with them the potential for disrupting funding,
                                collaboration networks, and labs. We hope to exchange ideas about how these
                                institutional
                                investigations work from the insideโnot often understood from the outside. The panelists
                                will discuss the kinds of issues and challenges they most often find. They will also
                                discuss
                                the role that technology could play in their work.

                            <p>
                                Despite peer-review and editorial screening, science papers can still contain images or
                                other data of concern. A visual scan of 20,000 papers published in 40 biomedical
                                journals
                                showed that 4% contained inappropriately duplicated images. Papers containing incorrect
                                or
                                even falsified data could lead to wasted time and money spent by other researchers

                                reproduce those results. Thorough image screening before publication would be beneficial
                                for
                                editors, publishers, and readers, and act as a deterrent for fraudulent submissions.

                                is a great need for high-throughput computational tools to find image duplications and
                                manipulations in scientific manuscripts, and to help detect the growing number of
                                fabricated
                                manuscripts produced by paper mills. Elisabeth Bik will present some case examples,

                            <p>Many academic institutions are of the opinion that they can simply solve the problem of
                                plagiarism by purchasing the use of so-called plagiarism detection software. But as a
                                recent test of such support tools shows, the systems don't find all plagiarism and will
                                report text overlap that is not plagiarism as if it were. Institutions that rely only
                                on some similarity measure for determining sanctions need to be aware of how meaningless
                                the numbers these systems report are.</p>
                            <p>In this talk the results of the recent test of support tools for detecting plagiarism
                                conducted by the European Network of Academic Integrity will be presented, followed
                                by a discussion of what constitutes the responsible use of such tools.</p>

                            <p>Advances in machine learning technologies have led to the rapid proliferation of
                                automated and semi-automated media (image, video, text, audio) manipulation and
                                synthesis technologies. These technologies make it easier for unskilled individuals to
                                create compelling media manipulations and may reduce our trust in many forms of
                                information. DARPA has made significant investments in the development of media
                                forensics tools that can help defend against such falsified media. This talk will
                                discuss trends in media falsification technologies and the work that has been developed
                                by DARPA programs to defend against falsified media.</p>

                                This panel will provide a funderโs perspective on research integrity. One view is on the
                                investigative role of research integrity issues. The panel may discuss how they
                                investigate
                                research integrity problems within their organization or organizations they oversee.
                                Cases
                                of scientific errors or misconduct not only severely impact science but also might
                                produce
                                significant losses to the funder. Some funders engage in direct research efforts to
                                understand research misconduct and educate scientists and institutions about it. Other
                                funders see research integrity and forensic science in general as a more fundamental
                                long-term threat to the foundations of science and even as a tool used by adversaries.
                                In
                                this sense, research integrity applications go beyond scientific research and might
                                percolate into other society areas, such as fake news generation and deception
                                capabilities.

                                Integrity</h5>
                            <p>
                                Numerous cases of scientific mistakes or even misconduct frequently appear in the media.
                                Scientists, publishers, and institutions care about these issues but are overwhelmed by
                                the
                                number of submissions: reviewing them is mostly done manually in a time consuming and
                                costly
                                manner. This presentation will suggest that we can use artificial intelligence (AI) to
                                improve
                                how
                                publications are filtered at an unprecedented scale and accuracy levels. The key to
                                achieving these goals is to take a page from AIโs book: create high-quality, large-scale
                                datasets of common scientific errors or potential misconduct that modern AI techniques
                                can
                                use to learn from and recognize. Akin to how AI has revolutionized object recognition,
                                speech recognition, and information retrieval, this new research integrity era, which we
                                call computational research integrity, promises to revolutionize how we detect errors
                                before
                                they get published. I will the research integrity competition to spearhead these new ideas.

                                One concrete result of computational approaches in research integrity will depend on the
                                development of tools. We all have become used to text plagiarism detection, but
                                researchers
                                could significantly expand these kinds of tools to other media modalities. This panel

                                The PubPeer website, dedicated to facilitating public
                                discussion of the scientific literature, launched in late 2012. Using
                                open metadata, it creates a dynamic page for every publication with a
                                Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or arXiv ID. Users can post and read
                                comments about each publication. This short-circuits the many
                                potentially conflicted actors stifling the correction of science:
                                authors, journals and institutions. By offering strong anonymity,
                                regulated by strict content guidelines and moderation, PubPeer has
                                created a protected space where even serious criticism could be aired
                                without risk of professional or legal reprisals. The site has helped
                                reveal an unsuspected volume of research misconduct. Users can be
                                alerted to discussion about articles as they work by installing the
                                PubPeer browser and Zotero plugins (which you should all do). Taking
                                stock after 8 years of operation, we stand by our
                                sometimes-controversial decision to allow regulated anonymous
                                commenting, which we believe has reinforced what we see as the primary
                                function of PubPeer - to serve as an early-warning system for readers
                                and users of articles. Official procedures for correcting science
                                remain too slow, unreliable and inefficient; this was especially
                                apparent during the pandemic. We aim to continue integrating sources
                                of high-quality discussion, with recent innovations including comments
                                from preprint servers, scientific Twitter and a sister site for
                                overlay journals called Peeriodicals. Journals and institutions can
                                receive tailored alerts via "PubPeer Dashboards". Our guiding
                                philosophy for the future is to accelerate scientific progress by
                                facilitating rapid, effective and public exchange of discussion about
                                publications, while eschewing all metrics and focusing on the
                                substance of scientific publications.

                            <p>
                                The COVID-19 pandemic has attracted significant attention to scientific matters related
                                to
                                the cause, treatment, and prevention of the disease that has upended our lives.
                                Alarmingly,
                                not all of the information available on the Internet is what it appears to be. Deceptive
                                memes, bogus ads, and fabricated infographics are proliferating, with all threatening to
                                undermine the public's trust in science. Given the vast scale of the problem, an
                                automated
                                capability that can identify new instances of visual disinformation, trace its origin,
                                and
                                ultimately flag it as being problematic is needed. But compared to text, visual content
                                presents unique challenges for media forensics. This talk presents an end-to-end
                                processing
                                pipeline for image provenance analysis, which works at real-world scale. It employs a
                                cutting-edge image filtering solution that is able to find related images, as well as
                                novel
                                techniques for obtaining a provenance graph that expresses how the images, as nodes, are
                                ancestrally connected. Building from provenance analysis, the talk goes on to introduce
                                a
                                scalable automated visual recognition pipeline for discovering meme genres of diverse
                                appearance. This pipeline can ingest meme images from a social network, apply computer
                                vision-based techniques to extract features and index new images into a database, and
                                then
                                organize the memes into related genres. Recent examples of visual disinformation
                                targeting
                                science will be highlighted, including repurposed imagery, parasitic advertising, and
                                pandemic-related memes. Finally, the talk will conclude with thoughts on continued
                                research
                                in this direction.

                            <p>Agnotology โ a new field dedicated to the study of ignorance -- has provided crucial
                                insights into the
                                corporate staging and management of scientific controversies on topics of great public
                                importance ranging
                                from the dangers of tobacco smoking to global warming, and others in between. (The book
                                and eponymous
                                film Merchants of Doubts or the work of Robert Proctor are examples). A shared goal of
                                these corporate
                                interventions, the agnotologists have argued, is the questioning of scientific evidence
                                and claims so as
                                to create the appearance that these issues are not matters of remarkably solid consensus
                                but, to the
                                contrary, the focus of substantial controversies among scientists themselves. The effect
                                of such
                                misinformation campaigns has been to splinter or confuse the publicโs response,
                                dangerously delaying
                                urgent regulatory interventions.</p>
                            <p>But while the agnotologistsโ goal has been to study the production of non-knowledge or
                                the destruction
                                of knowledge -- from the feeding of false beliefs to the public to actively creating
                                gaps in the
                                availability of knowledge by making it secret -- their most original and interesting
                                contribution has
                                been the thick description of the techniques, strategies, and rhetoric of the production
                                of doubt about
                                science and medicine โ something that is exceptionally effective precisely because it is
                                neither truth
                                nor falsehood, neither knowledge nor ignorance. Its power is its elusiveness.</p>
                            <p>Adding new examples to those exposed by the agnotologists, I argue that the production of
                                doubt is not
                                the production of ignorance but an essentially different regime that, while coming to
                                life in the
                                traditional form of scientific controversies, it does not aim at producing or
                                manipulating the content
                                of knowledge but at strategically subverting the norms of science as a profession. The
                                production of
                                doubt is neither the negative mirror image of the production of positive knowledge, nor
                                simply a
                                scientific Potemkin village where politics is camouflaged as science. Given the
                                extraordinarily high
                                stakes involved, it may be comforting to believe that, while highly damaging to the
                                credibility of science,
                                the systematic production of doubt is also completely external to it. It is politics,
                                not science.
                                I share the agnotologistsโ sentiments and commitments, and believe that science and the
                                corporate production
                                of doubt are driven by radically different goals. Sadly, however, they are not easily
                                separable in a formal,
                                conceptual sense. The strategic production of doubt is a very specific form of
                                parasitism that cannot exist
                                outside of its host. Its effectiveness derives only from mobilizing the authority of
                                science against itself.</p>

                                This presentation asks whether and how technical tools can help facilitate the

                                will discuss some of the factors that speak for and against the use of technology and
                                have a look at the image integrity database (IIDB), which we have build in Berlin to
                                provide training data for algorithm development.

                                Rapid publication of results โ particularly on preprint servers โ has grown dramatically
                                during the COVID-19 pandemic, and has forced researchers, health care professionals,
                                journalists, and others to grapple with the concept of reliable and actionable
                                information.
                                The pandemic has given rise to more than 80 retractions at the time of this writing. Is
                                that
                                cause for concern? My lens for this talk will be ten years of experience reporting on

                                Journalists have uncovered many scientific integrity cases that have helped us

                                There is no doubt that the whistleblower and private investigators' role has become
                                increasingly crucial for vetting and correcting scientific research. In this panel, the
                                members will discuss their role in research integrity, their motivations, approaches,
                                and
                                threats they face. The panel may also discuss how bad actors are adapting and creating
                                new
                                types of misconduct that are becoming impossible to catch on time or entirely invisible.
